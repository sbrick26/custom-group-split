Group Split Calculator
-------------------------------
This project is a simple Python project that allows a user to input n amount of friends and determine who owes who based on the payments provided by each person in the group.

The user is first prompted to input the names of everyone in the group and is then asked to input the payments made by each person for the group. The program accepts n payments, and at the end, when all payments are inputted, provides a simple table on who owes who how much.

This project utilizes input statments, print statement, nested loops, recursive functions, and custom made functions for splitting the group cost correctly between n number of friends.
